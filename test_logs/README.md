# Test Logs Directory

This directory contains all test execution logs generated by the unit test runner.

## Purpose
- Stores detailed logs of all unit test executions
- Provides historical record of test runs
- Helps with debugging test failures
- Tracks test performance over time

## File Naming Convention
Log files are named with the pattern: `test_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`

Example: `test_log_20250730_231249.txt`

## Contents
Each log file contains:
- Complete test execution output (stdout)
- Test results and status (stderr)
- Execution timestamp and duration
- Overall test summary

## Usage
- Run tests: `python run_tests_with_log.py`
- Logs are automatically saved to this directory
- Check the latest log file for recent test results
- Compare logs to track test stability over time

## Cleanup
Old log files can be safely deleted to save space. Consider keeping logs from the last 30 days for debugging purposes.
