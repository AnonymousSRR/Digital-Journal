# Code Review Report

## 1. Inputs
- **Review Scope**: Uncommitted changes only
- **Git Status Snapshot**:
```
?? "Plan Reviewer Results/plan_review_daily_streak_card.md"
?? "stories and plans/implementation plans/implementation_plan_daily_streak_card.md"
```
- **Files Reviewed**:
  - Plan Reviewer Results/plan_review_daily_streak_card.md (untracked)
  - stories and plans/implementation plans/implementation_plan_daily_streak_card.md (untracked)

## 2. Review Status
**Overall Match**: Yes

## 3. Decision Rules
- If any Critical or High issue exists → Overall Match: No
- If only Medium / Low issues exist → Overall Match: Yes

## 4. Summary
The uncommitted changes consist solely of two documentation/planning files: an implementation plan and its corresponding review report. No actual code, configuration, tests, or templates have been modified or added. Since these are planning documents with no code implementation, there are no Critical or High issues affecting code quality, security, or functionality.

## 5. Findings

### Critical
- None

### High
- None

### Medium
- None

### Low
- **File**: Plan Reviewer Results/plan_review_daily_streak_card.md (entire file)
  - **What**: Plan review document added without corresponding implementation
  - **Why**: Best practice is to commit implementation code alongside or before review artifacts
  - **Impact**: Minimal - this is a documentation file that tracks planning state, but indicates implementation is pending
  - **Suggested Fix**: Complete the implementation phases described in the plan before committing review artifacts, or clearly mark this as "pre-implementation review"

- **File**: stories and plans/implementation plans/implementation_plan_daily_streak_card.md (entire file)
  - **What**: Implementation plan document added without corresponding code changes
  - **Why**: Implementation plans typically accompany or precede actual code changes
  - **Impact**: Minimal - serves as a roadmap for future work
  - **Suggested Fix**: Either implement the planned changes in the same commit, or clearly mark this as a planning-only commit

## 6. Test Coverage Review
- **Tests Added/Modified?**: No
- **Missing Tests (if any)**:
  - Not applicable - no code changes to test
- **Risky Changes Without Tests (if any)**:
  - Not applicable - no code changes present

## 7. File-by-File Notes

### File: Plan Reviewer Results/plan_review_daily_streak_card.md
- **Type**: Documentation / Planning artifact
- **Notes**:
  - Contains a comprehensive review of the implementation plan status
  - Correctly identifies that no code has been implemented yet
  - Provides detailed phase-by-phase analysis of what's missing
  - Includes actionable recommendations for next steps
  - Well-structured and follows a clear format

### File: stories and plans/implementation plans/implementation_plan_daily_streak_card.md
- **Type**: Documentation / Implementation plan
- **Notes**:
  - Comprehensive 4-phase implementation plan for daily streak card feature
  - Includes detailed code snippets, test cases, and technical considerations
  - Properly references existing codebase files and line numbers
  - Covers backend integration, frontend display, styling, and real-time updates
  - Addresses edge cases, performance, and security considerations

## 8. Next Steps
- If Overall Match = Yes:
  - [ ] Proceed with Phase 1 implementation as outlined in the implementation plan
  - [ ] Create backend integration in authentication/views.py
  - [ ] Create tests/test_daily_streak.py with initial test cases
  - [ ] Continue through all 4 phases sequentially
  - [ ] Consider committing planning documents separately from implementation code for cleaner git history
